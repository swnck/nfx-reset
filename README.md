**NFX Reset** is a lightweight Chrome extension that brings back a missing feature to Netflix: **A true Reset button.** 

Tired of Netflix automatically jumping to the credits or starting a show at the last 2 minutes because you've seen it before? With NFX Reset, you can clear your playback progress with a single click directly in the Netflix interface.

## 🛠️ How it works

1.  **Injection:** The `content.js` script identifies the current title on your Netflix page and injects a "Reset" button.
2.  **Authentication:** When clicked, it retrieves your current profile ID from local storage.
3.  **Reset:** The `background.js` script sends an authenticated request to Netflix's internal API to clear the "Watched" status.
4.  **Refresh:** The page reloads, and you can start your show from $0:00$.

## 🔒 Permissions & Privacy

We value your privacy. The extension only requests the minimum necessary permissions:
*   `cookies`: To authenticate the reset request with your existing Netflix session.
*   `https://www.netflix.com/](https://www.netflix.com/*`: To modify the UI and add the button.
*   `https://web.prod.cloud.netflix.com/](https://web.prod.cloud.netflix.com/*`: To communicate with the Netflix API.

**No data is ever sent to us. Your Netflix data stays between you and Netflix.**
